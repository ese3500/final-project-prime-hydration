## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

In a few sentences, describe your final project. This abstract will be used as the description in the evaluation survey forms.

Our final project is an automated alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink mixer meant to take the hassle out of creating fun drinks for you and your friends. This machine will feature an LCD screen to display a custom user interface where users can select which drinks they want to be made, a joystick/button to navigate the user interface, motors to handle the dispensing and mixing of liquids, and lastly an ID scanner (or breathalyzer) to ensure legal consumption. All of these features are meant to take the hassle out of preparing beverages for themselves or guests, and let them "set and forget" their drink menu.  

### 2. Motivation

What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?

When hosting social events, preparing to serve guests beverages can be a deceptively daunting task. What do people want to drink? What ingredients do each of the drinks need? How much of each ingredient do I need to buy? How can I make sure that I'm following the law and only serving those over 21? And lastly, how does one make those drinks? Who will make drinks for our guests and when? Our project will hope to answer all these questions by distilling all these questions down to two. What ingredients do I need to buy, and when do I need to refill? This project is intersting because not only does it solve a real-world problem with a tangible solution, but it will feature modularity that will allow users to customize the solution to their own needs.

### 3. Goals

These are to help guide and direct your progress.

Must Haves

1. Have a consistent, controlled, and accurate fluid-dispensing system.

2. Create a user interface that is as simple and light as possible.

3. Design an exterior that allows for easy user entry and replacement of liquids.

4. Find a good balance between speed and precision when making drinks.

Additional

5. Implement variable mixing speeds depending on the beverage.

6. If the ID scanner is implemented, then implement a breathalyzer, or vice versa.

7. Program different presets, where users can select which set of drinks the machine can make.

8. Use a distance sensor to sense whether a cup has been placed in the correct position to allow liquid to flow.

### 4. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Formulate key software requirements here.

1. Intuitive and simple user interface to select which drink to make.

2. Program that will accurately control the dispensing of different liquids.

3. Program that can handle ID scanning (or breathalyzer input).

### 5. Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)

Formulate key hardware requirements here.

1. Modular liquid storage system. This is where the various ingredients are stored and should be easy for users to change/refill the contents.

2. Mixing system. A clean and effective method for mixing the ingredients for a drink.

3. Liquid dispensing system. An accurate and consistent system for dispensing the ingredients.

### 6. MVP Demo

What do you expect to accomplish by the first milestone?

We expect to have a machine that depending on user input, can dispense a subset of available liquids at variable and accurate amounts. 

### 7. Final Demo

What do you expect to achieve by the final demonstration or after milestone 1?

By the final demonstration, we expect our project to be able to create a drink with no manual input from the user other than their drink of choice. This means that the device will have a UI that the user can traverse using some form of input hardware. Once the user has specified which drink they want, the device will then accurately dispense the ingredients for the specific drink into a cup and then mix it. 

### 8. Methodology

What is your approach to the problem?



### 9. Components

What major components do you need and why?



### 10. Evaluation

What is your metric for evaluating how well your product/solution solves the problem? Think critically on this section. Having a boolean metric such as “it works” is not very useful. This is akin to making a speaker and if it emits sound, albeit however terrible and ear wrenching, declare this a success.
It is recommended that your project be something that you can take pride in. Oftentimes in interviews, you will be asked to talk about projects you have worked on.

We believe the success of our device will not just be whether it works, but rather how consistent and easy it is to use. Here is how we would evaluate the different aspects of the project.

Physical Design:

- How compact is it?

- How difficult will it be to refill the different liquids?

- Are the different components placed in logical places?

- Is it (somewhat) visually appealing?

User Interface/Interaction:

- How intuitive is the user interface?

- Is the interface quick and responsive to use (not frustrating)?

- Reduce the number of steps and different menus users have to use.

Drink Ingredient Dispensing:

- How accurate is the liquid dispensing system?

- How consistent is the liquid dispensing system?

Drink Mixing:

- How well does the mixing system mix the ingredients together?

General:

- How does it taste?

### 11. Timeline

This section is to help guide your progress over the next few weeks. Feel free to adjust and edit the table below to something that would be useful to you. Really think about what you want to accomplish by the first milestone.

| **Week**            | **Task** | **Assigned To**    |
|----------           |--------- |------------------- |
| Week 1: 3/24 - 3/31 |          |                    |
| Week 2: 4/1 - 4/7   |          |                    |
| Week 3: 4/8 - 4/14  |          |                    |
| Week 4: 4/15 - 4/21 |          |                    |
| Week 5: 4/22 - 4/26 |          |                    |

### 12. Proposal Presentation

Add your slides to the Final Project Proposal slide deck in the Google Drive.

## Final Project Report

Don't forget to make the GitHub pages public website!
If you’ve never made a Github pages website before, you can follow this webpage (though, substitute your final project repository for the Github username one in the quickstart guide):  <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart>

### 3. Results

What were your results? Namely, what was the final solution/design to your problem?

#### 3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Results

Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected software requirements. You should be quantifying this, using measurement tools to collect data.

#### 3.2 Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS) Results

Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected hardware requirements. You should be quantifying this, using measurement tools to collect data.

### 4. Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to consider: What did you learn from it? What went well? What accomplishments are you proud of? What did you learn/gain from this experience? Did you have to change your approach? What could have been done differently? Did you encounter obstacles that you didn’t anticipate? What could be a next step for this project?
